      <description>In the previous articles (Probabilistic Finality, DAG) we looked into how Probabilistic Finality works and how DAGs can help to find the longest chain.
Today we are going have a look at implementing a basic DAG in Crystal. We will focus on implementing a DAG::Vertex class and finding the vertex with the longest distance from a given starting vertex. Each vertex will have a unique name and a Hash to represent its edges pointing to its children.</description>

      <description>How to use a DAG to find the longest chain 1. Introduction
In the first part #1 we talked about how probabilistic finality works and why it&amp;rsquo;s needed. Also we saw an example of how blocks might be structured and linked to each other:
The data structure above resembles a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and fortunately DAGs allow for an easy way to find the longest chain. This is an important part of achieving probabilistic finality.</description>

      <description>This is the first part in a series that will teach you how to develop a full featured blockchain from scratch. First you have to understand some concepts behind blockchain technology and how they work together.
In this article we will focus on the concept of &amp;ldquo;Probabilistic Finality&amp;rdquo;.
1. Probabilistic Finality
Finality is the agreement that a valid transaction between A and B has been executed and can&amp;rsquo;t be reverted.</description>
