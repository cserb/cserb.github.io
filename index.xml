      <description>In the previous articles (Probabilistic Finality, DAG) we looked into how Probabilistic Finality works and how DAGs can help to find the longest chain.
Today we are going have a look at implementing a basic DAG in Crystal. We will focus on implementing a DAG::Vertex class and finding the vertex with the longest distance from a given starting vertex. Each vertex will have a unique name and a Hash to represent its edges pointing to its children.</description>

      <description>How to use a DAG to find the longest chain 1. Introduction
In the first part #1 we talked about how probabilistic finality works and why it&amp;rsquo;s needed. Also we saw an example of how blocks might be structured and linked to each other:
The data structure above resembles a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and fortunately DAGs allow for an easy way to find the longest chain. This is an important part of achieving probabilistic finality.</description>

      <description>This is the first part in a series that will teach you how to build a full featured blockchain from scratch. Introduction I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to cover all aspects in detail, neither is it intended. You should rather make yourself familiar with the high level concept of how a blockchain works. As kind of a reference point you should be familiar with Andreas Antonopoulos&amp;rsquo; book Mastering Bitcoin, which if needed covers quite some detail.</description>
